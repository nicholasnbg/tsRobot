This project is a repeat of the "Toy Robot" challenge from the previous repo see https://github.com/edrans/toy-robot-challenge for the specifics.

This project is useful for me for three reasons. One I have received feedback from the previous project which I intend to use here, this will be my first time using TypeScript outside of following tutorials and lastly I will use testing in this project which is also a first for me.
